One star books (<span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>) are certainly worth reading if you have prior interest in the subject matter, and two star books (<span class="primary-color">â˜…â˜…</span>) are definitely worth reading regardless of prior interest.

- **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind** by Yuval Noah Harari <span class="primary-color">â˜…â˜…</span>

  I was tuned into *Sapiens* from its inclusion in [Bill Gates's 2016 summer reading list](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2016). Who would've thought: Bill Gates has a pretty good taste in books ðŸ˜‰.

  *Sapiens* is a pleasant read for two reasons: comfortable prose and clear theses. This is not to say that the book is simplistic or boring. It's the opposite: that the language and structure of the book do so much to keep it an engaging read. I almost couldn't help but read more.

  One thing I will note is that I was surprised (pleasantly so) by the "philosophy" in the pages of the book. I found myself generally agreeable to many of Yuval Noah Harari's posits and propositions. But a different perspective on these philosophical points might cloud your perception of the work.

- **Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good** by Chuck Collins <span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>

  At times, the book reads a little one-dimensional in its interpretation of the issues facing the world today. But Chuck Collins does a fine job making the case for those in the 1% to give back, and he does so with many suggestions for practical actions.

  If you agree with his assumptions and worldview, then this book will be a convincing and inspiring read. If you agree with some, but not all of Collins's points (as I do), then this book will be a provocative and ambitious read.

- **Sum** by David Eagleman <span class="primary-color">â˜…â˜…</span>

  I first picked up this book after hearing about it on episode 77 of the [Hello Internet podcast](http://www.hellointernet.fm/). By coincidence, the author of the book, David Eagleman, is a neuroscientist who studies the perception of time. Turns out, Eagleman was heavily featured in another book I finished earlier this year called *Why Time Flies: A Mostly Scientific Investigation*.

  *Sum* is not what you expect from someone whose career is as an academic. It's purely a work of fiction, an imaginative exploration of conceptions of the afterlife. Its sections are short, often spanning only two or three pages. Some of the conceptions begin to feel repetitive, but they are all short enough that something new is always around the corner.

  I'm sure everyone will find a couple of the conceptions particularly intellectually stimulating for themselves. For me, I found the first (Sum) and the second to last (Search) the most memorable.

- **Whistlestop: My Favorite Stories from Presidential Campaign History** by John Dickerson <span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>

  A light and enjoyable read. It's a collection of 15-minute or so stories, each about a past presidential campaign. A gentle reminder that as crazy as the news seem today, in one way or another, politics has always sort of been this way.

- **Why Time Flies: A Mostly Scientific Investigation** by Alan Burdick <span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>

   This book is certainly an enjoyable read. I finished it in about a month with on-and-off reading. If it's not evident, this book is mainly about the brainâ€”about two-thirds neuroscience, one-third philosophy. I would've preferred more philosophy than neuroscience, but the presentation of both topics is accessible and interesting.

- **If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens ... WHERE IS EVERYBODY?** by Stephen Webb <span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>

   When thinking about the Fermi Paradox, the uncertain and unknowable nature of the paradox can make the discussion very esoteric. But Stephen Webb describes solutions to the Fermi Paradox in a totally accessible manner. I think it's an example of the best kind of science writing that doesn't over simplify for the wow factor, but that gives a thorough yet accessible treatment of the topic.

   As a side benefit, Webb's disciplined discussion of the Fermi Paradox provides a framework that can be applied to many other common problems. We are often faced with problems with uncertain outcomes and equally uncertain probabilities. One choice we have is to throw up our hands and make decisions based on gut feeling. The other choice is to apply intuition and get *some* answerâ€”which is certainly better than none at all. That's what Webb does in the book to great effect.

   Note: I did not know this when I read the book, but Webb has released an updated version of the book that now includes 75 (up from 50) solutions to the Fermi Paradox. Bonus: If you have access to Springer Link (I have access through my college), you can [get a DRM-free PDF ](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-13236-5).

- **The Man Who Knew: The Life and Times of Alan Greenspan** by Sebastian Mallaby <span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>

  Sebastien Mallaby goes to great lengths in this biography to support his hypothesis that Alan Greenspan is, and has always been, less caricature than he has been made out to be. Whether it be the "maestro" who received bi-partisan support during his tenure, or the post-2008 revisionist perspective of a ideological to a fault laissez-faire libertarian, Mallaby makes a strong case that the truthâ€”as it often doesâ€”lies somewhere in the middle.

  I am quite partial to Mallaby's rejection of the Great Man Theory when characterizing Greenspan. I believe that we over-index on individual agency when explaining both success and failure. It leads to false hope and inevitable disappointment in politics. And it often creates a dangerous culture of hubris.

- **Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis** by J.D. Vance <span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>

  *Hillbilly Elegy* is certainly worth a read because of how it describes a a white, working-class culture of Appalachia that isn't often talked about. J.D. Vance manages to describe it well by being nuanced throughout. Very few things are binary, and Vance's description of hillbilly culture is no different. When talking about social issues partisanship and loaded terms (e.g. "welfare queen") often bring conversation to a standstill. But I think that this book does a fine job avoiding those traps.

## 2016

- **Ready Player One** by Ernest Cline

  I read *Ready Player One* after seeing many recommendations for the book over time. If you are familiar with popular culture from the 1980s, I am quite sure this will be an enjoyable read. If you are not familiar with 80s pop culture, you will be fine for also passing over *Ready Player One*.

- **A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing** by Burton Malkiel <span class="primary-color">â˜…â˜…</span>

  > ...telling most investors that there is no hope of beating the averages is like telling a six-year-old that there is no Santa Claus. It takes the zing out of life.

  More than anything else, the highest praise that can be given for *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* is that it is a no-nonsense book. Burton Malkiel advocates that index-based investing ought to form the core of most every individual investor's portfolio. No more stock-picking, investment advisors, or hot gossip about which tech company will be the Facebook from your buddy at the golf course.

  Here is one analogy that I always come back to when thinking about how ludicrous it is that more investors don't practice low-fee, index investing. There are millions of active traders in the stock market: traders for big Wall Street banks, mutual fund and hedge fund managers, and many day-traders at home. To think that by spending 5 hours a week reading Forbes and Yahoo Finance gives you enough information to beat the professionals is a little like thinking that you can play in the NBA by practicing 5 hours a week.

  Stock trading is a zero-sum game. Every winner who buys an underpriced security needs a schlub on the other end selling an underpriced security. Every winner who sells an overpriced security needs a schlub on the other end buying an overpriced security. In fact, because of transaction fees, it is often the case that both traders are schlubs, and only the broker comes out ahead. So it's you against the professionals. You against LeBron James in a game of 1-on-1 to 10. You against Tiger Woods in 18-hole match play. Yes, you might get a lucky basket on LeBron, and you might chip in against Tiger to take a hole from him. But luck and skill should not be confused.

  It's also refreshing to see that the current edition of the book, the 11th, is a legitimate 11th edition. Too often, textbook publishers create new editions simply by rearranging chapters, reordering exercises, and changing the typesetting of the bookâ€”all without one material change to the actual content. In this edition, Malkiel addresses recent challenges to the Efficient-Market Hypothesis, such as behavioral finance and "smart beta." What's more, he includes recent economic data up through 2014, when this edition was published.

- **God and Man at Yale** by William F. Buckley <span class="primary-color">â˜…</span>

  > Again, I maintain that most universities have espousedâ€”and continue to do soâ€”collectively, one value as opposed to another.

  While I certainly don't agree with everything in this book, I thought it a worthwhile read. There are many more smart things than dumb things in this book.

  > It is plain that the president of a university cannot transmit to the students his own values directly. his duties are so extensive that to conduct classes on a large scale is a practical impossibility. He must therefore utilize intermediaries, men of similar convictions, to do the job. This academic freedom forbids. It is therefore an appalling yet indisputable fact that because of the restraints of "academic freedom," the president of Yale has far less influence on the student body than have scores of influential professors who are allowedâ€”in fact encouragedâ€”to teach just as they will , to traffic, within loose limits, in whatever values they choose.

  >It is curious that the Corporation spends so much time and effort in selecting a president.

- **On Boxing** by Joyce Carol Oates <span class="primary-color">â˜…â˜…</span>

  > ...for boxing is about failure far more than it is about success.

  There are no shortage of reviews and responses to this timeless Joyce Carol Oates anthology of essays about, and on, boxing. And rightly so. For a longtime outsider to the world of combat sports who only started paying more attention recently, beginning with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao last year, *On Boxing* captures perfectly what is so electric and captivating about boxing.

  I can tell you, though, that it's not a rigid historical account of the all of the great 20th century boxing moments. Instead, this book explains *why* boxing is so enthralling. Boxing is in many ways the most primitive of sports, but Oates does a masterful job of encapsulating those ancient feelings and actions with words. This book, while short, is not superficial. *On Boxing* places you decades deep inside the culture of boxing. It's like when you listen to your grandfather talk about his past or when someone like Elon Musk talks about technology, some people have a way of communicating the essence of something so well that you walk away with your mouth wide open because things make *sense* now. That is what Oates has done. A lifetime of experience in only 200 some odd pages. Not a bad deal.

  To illustrate, Oates in her own words on boxing:

  > Which returns us to the paradox of boxing: its obsessive appeal for many who find in it not only a spectacle involving sensational feats of physical skill but an emotional experience impossible to convey in words; an art form, as I've suggested, with no natural analogue in the arts. Of course it is primitive, too, as birth, death and erotic love might be said to be primitive, and forces our reluctant acknowledgement of that the most profound experiences of our lives are physical eventsâ€”though we believe ourselves to be, and surely are, essentially spiritual beings.

- **Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt** by Michael Lewis

  > They traded in the market the way card counters in a casino played blackjack: They played only when they had an edge.

  As the saying goes, don't bring a knife to a gunfight. If you're an individual investor on Wall Street, the lesson from Michael Lewis's *Flash Boys* is that you have the knife, and the high frequency traders have the guns. It's a fools gameâ€”no different than roulette at the casino. The house knows the odds, and they're not in your favor.

  *Flash Boys*, if a little repetitive towards the end, was an enjoyable read written accessibly with solid characters and an easy to follow narrative.
