title: "Taylor Swift's New Direction: Putting <i>1989</i> in Perspective"
---

Note, I will use the past tense to refer to everything previous to Taylor's new album, *1989*, and the present tense to refer to the *1989* era.[^1]

<hr>

I haven't been on the Taylor Swift bandwagon forever. When I first heard "Teardrops on My Guitar," I wrote her off as kitschy and "a fad."

But as things have their way of happening, no longer than two years after my initial sour reaction, my opinions changed. I saw past my first impressions and fell in love with her music.

Five years ago I couldn't have told you what made Taylor's music was so magnetic. It just was.

Now, though, I know what that "X-Factor" was.[^2]

Here are two examples:[^3]

I was attracted to the anecdotes.

<div class="text-center"><i>When you think happiness <br>
I hope you think that little black dress <br>
Think of my head on your chest <br>
And my old faded blue jeans <br>
When you think Tim McGraw <br>
I hope you think of me</i><br><br></div>

<div class="text-center"><i>The playful conversation starts <br>
Counter all your quick remarks <br>
Like passing notes in secrecy</i></div>

Those moments full of feeling and depth. *I* was a part of Taylor's life. I was a part of her freshmen year. I knew about [her crush on that guy named Drew][freshman crush]. I knew about [the time when she thought she fell in love][fifteen song]. She could match the massive appeal of [Katy Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F57P9C4SAW4) while writing about [one, single guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y28pUGkk9vc).

Which is way "Shake It Off" worries me.

What happened? I suppose this change was a long time coming. Taylor has sold more than 34 million albums,[^4] has won [*226* awards][Taylor Swift awards list], and lives in a [New York City penthouse][]. So should I be surprised that *Shake It Off* lacks the small-town stories of yesteryear?

No. I shouldn't be. It was clear from *Red* that change was afoot.

*We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together* (*WANEGBT*) was still personal, but all signs turned toward pop. The lyrics lacked passion. The days of faded blue jeans, old Chevy trucks, and princesses were gone. The song was no longer driven by songwriting. Instead, *WANEGBT* relied on the incessant beat of an electronic drum. Taylor even seemed to admit this herself by [releasing a revised version][WANEGBT country version] of the song to country music radio stations.

However, even though *Red* signaled the impending change, it also reaffirmed Taylor's country roots.

## What to make of *1989*?

From all accounts, *1989* will be an [all-pop album][1989 all pop].[^5] But can I blame Taylor? No. Her songwriting has always been based on her personal experiences. Living in New York City, flying in a private jet, and hanging out with other pop stars *is* her new life. But for Taylor, that creates a paradox. She got her start writing about issues common to all teenagers. She, more than anyone else, could capture the emotion, intimacy, and heartbreak of growing up.

But now, Taylor doesn't live that life, which explains why *Shake It Off* lacks the "X-Factor" of her previous endeavors.

Don't get me wrong, I think "Shake It Off" is a great song.[^6] But at its heart, it's pop music.

In two years, I wonder if I will still be listening to "Shake It Off" and the rest of *1989*. My guess is probably not. I will, however, still be listening to *Taylor Swift*, *Fearless*, *Speak Now*, and half of *Red*. Thinking about it that way, there really is nothing to lament about Taylor's move to pop music. She has given me, and millions of others, hours of music that I love, so who am I to complain?

[^3]: Can we all also agree that her old music videos were so much better?

[^4]: 26 million from [this 2011 press release][Big Machine press release] plus 8 million from [Red][Red album sales].

[^5]: It won't even be officially released to country music stations.
