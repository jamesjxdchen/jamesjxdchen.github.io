## George's Roasters & Ribs

Chicken
Very meaty. Large wing, with plenty of meat on the bone, which is a big plus. The one downside is that the deep fryer does't seem to add any kind of fantastic crispy layer, or any fantastic flavor. It sort of heats it up, almost like a hybrid between baking and frying. Seasoned with pepper, it's a solid foundation for the wings. Tastes almost like a rotisserie chicken.

Blue Cheese Sauce
Mild in flavor. Reminds me more of the strength if a chipotle mayonaise, except replace the chiptle with blue cheese. Very creamy, there are no chunks of blue cheese in the sauce, which is a little disappointing.  almost a bit sweet (could just be that the wings's saltiness makes this illusion). Pairs welll with the wings, as a sidekick, not the main show. But on the celery, it almost blends in too much with the neutrality of that, doesn't provide the fresh savory contrast that you quite want. Most similar maybe to a tathziki sauce, it will complement the food, bring it together, but it isn't quite the star of the show. Would like more blue cheese flavor.

Hot Sauce
Offer mild and hot, the hot begins to feel a little vinegary, the mild is probably the better balance given the subduedness of the chicken and blue cheese in this dish. Has a nice thickness, where you can rub the wings around in the sauce, and the sauce will stick to the wing.

Celery
No problems here. Cut into manuverable pieces. Was crisp to the bite.

Takeaway
Solid value. Wings are of a nice size, you can get a meal for under $10 no problem. Nothing blows you away about these wings. But they are strong around the board. Phillip Rivers. Dependable. Good stats. Doesn't blow you away.
