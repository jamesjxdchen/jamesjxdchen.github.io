*Focused and professional.*

This is a site that I am building for a one-person consulting shop. The site hasn't yet gone live, but the design is mostly finished.

## [Newspaper Redesign for *The Lawrence*][the lawrence] (2014-2015)
*Bringing the print to the web.*

This is a project that I worked on for my school newspaper. I built a brand-new WordPress theme to meet the specific demands of our newspaper.
